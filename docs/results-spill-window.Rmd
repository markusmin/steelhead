## Description

This page contains the results for the effects of spill (as the volume of spill) on key movements. As a reminder for how spill (volume) is included in the model, spill (volume) has an effect on every mainstem downstream movement. The same parameter is shared by all fish of the same DPS/rear type combination. On this page, I show how spill volume affects en-route fallback throughout the basin.


### Calculation

For each dataset (combination of DPS and rear type), the following steps were run:

1. Extract the median covariate values experienced by all fish in the dataset (for winter spill days and temperature). These median values are used to estimate the probability of movement.
2. Create a sequence of volume of spill from 0 to the maximimum value experience by fish in the dataset.
3. Evaluate the probability of movement at each of those spill values.

If a tributary has both a hatchery and natural origin population, they are shown on the same plot.
