# README for site_figures 

Because it doesn't seem like github.io pages allows you to reference figures in folders
that are outside of docs/ I am having to copy figures from elsewhere into this folder.
The point of this README is to track where those figures are coming from so that I 
know how the figures are generated.

/Users/markusmin/Documents/CBR/steelhead/figures/full_model_diagram.png

The following figures are being generated on hyak because the files are so large, which makes it such
that they can't be generated using the Rmd files for the website.

/Users/markusmin/Documents/CBR/steelhead/stan_actual/reparameterization/analysis/output/conv_eff/
/Users/markusmin/Documents/CBR/steelhead/stan_actual/reparameterization/analysis/output/traceplots/
/Users/markusmin/Documents/CBR/steelhead/stan_actual/reparameterization/analysis/output/pairs_plots/

UC_MCN_temp_v_date.png is generated by script 28, but saved directly in docs/site_figures/
