## Analysis updates for Columbia Basin Steelhead modeling project

This website contains the most up-to-date information on the model structure, diagnostics, and results for the movement model for the adult migration of Steelhead in the Columbia River Basin.


### Design of this website

The content of this website is divided into multiple sections:

1. Structure: This tab contains information on how the model is set up, how covariates are included, the model equations, and how the model was implemented in Stan.
2. Diagnostics: This tab contains various diagnostics, including r-hat and effective sample size statistics, traceplots, and pairs plots.
3. Results - final fates: This contains the final fate simulations based on the model estimated parameters.
4. Results - temperature: This shows the effects of temperature on key movements (overshoot).
5. Results - spill (volume): This shows the effects of spill (as volume of spill) on en-route fallback probabilities.
6. Results - spill (days of winter spill): This shows the effects of spill (as the days of winter spill) on post-overshoot fallback probabilities.
7. Results - annual differences: This shows the parameter estimates for the random effect of year, as well as how all model inputs combine to estimate different probabilities of movement by year.
