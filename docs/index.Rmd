## Analysis updates for Columbia Basin Steelhead modeling project

This website contains the most up-to-date information on the model structure, diagnostics, and results for the movement model for the adult migration of Steelhead in the Columbia River Basin.


### Design of this website

The content of this website is currently divided into three sections:

1. Structure: This tab contains information on how the model is set up, how covariates are included, the model equations, and how the model was implemented in Stan.
2. Diagnostics: This tab contains various diagnostics, including r-hat and effective sample size statistics, traceplots, and pairs plots.
3. Results: This contains preliminary results from the current version of the model.
