## Description

This page will contain information on the model results for the version of the model described in the model structure section.

As of right now, all figures shown below are preliminary versions (or only descriptions) of possible figures for the paper.

# Figures

### Figure 1: Hatchery vs. wild (natural) origin movement probabilities for key movements, such as overshoot (intercept + origin)

Comparing estimates for key parameters is one way to visualize this, as seen in the figure below. However, comparing parameter estimates on their own is not the full picture, as seen by the collinearity between parameters that can be seen on the diagnostics tab.

![Comparison of the intercept term for ascending Priest Rapids Dam for hatchery and wild Upper Columbia Steelhead. The width of the posteriors are governed by the different sample sizes, with there being far more hatchery than wild fish for this DPS.](site_figures/posterior_comparison_plots/b0_matrix_3_4_comp_plot.png){width=50%}

### Figure 2: The effect of temperature (summer and winter)
This might be a bit more tricky than spill because there are two temperature covariates, and there are origin-specific effects

<br>

### Figure 3: The effect of spill (volume)
Note that spill is conveniently shared between DPSs

<br>

### Figure 4: The effect of spill (window)

<br>

### Figure 5: Final fates of fish, from different tributaries
