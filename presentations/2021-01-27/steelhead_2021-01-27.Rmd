# Overarching objective: Develop multidirectional model


## Focusing on river reaches rather than detection sites
- PIT tag arrays are used to determine transitions between "states," where states are different river reaches, either in the mainstem of the Snake or Columbia Rivers, or in tributaries
- Movements between states can either be explicitly contained within the detection history (PIT tag array detections), or *implied* by the other detections in the detection history
  - This "implicit site usage" allows estimation of movement for the full, interpolated detection history, and thus multidirectional movement - more on this later

## Parameters at each state
![](.//figures/JDR_simple_example.png){width=100%}

## Parameters overview
- Probabilties for an individual in the mainstem (sum to 1):
  - Overshoot the upstream dam (***o***)
  - Fallback over the downstream dam (***f***)
  - Stray to a non-natal tributary (***s***)
  - Home to natal tributaries (***h***) - only for individuals in the reach that connects to the natal tributary
  - Undetermined loss (***l***), when the detection history ends

- Probabilties for individuals in tributaries (sum to 1):
  - Undetermined loss (***l***) - end of detection history, likely indicates spawning
  - Return to mainstem (***r***)

## Complete parameterization

## Model structure

### What subscripts for each parameter?
- Run year
- Natal origin
- memory (of overshoot, fallback, tributary dip-ins)

### Implementation: Bayesian hierarchical?
- "Robin Hood" approach, where we can use information from more data-rich run years or natal origins to inform priors for data-poor run years or natal origins
  - Hierarchical modeling informed by biology


# Reformatting data for multidirectional model


## Distinguishing detection events
- Complete tag history (individual detections at arrays) queried from PTAGIS
- 6 hour cutoff used for separating events
- Exported file containing detections at individual sites, plus times of first and last times at the site for that detection

## Filling in missing movements
### Rules for determining "implicit site usage":
- No teleporting - if two consecutive detections are in non-adjacent sites, the intermediate sites must be used
- For detections at adult fishways, the individual must have been in the downstream section previously
- For movement into/out of tributaries, the individual must have been in the corresponding section of the mainstem before/after
- For consecutive detections at dams, the individual must fall back in between


## Determining "implicit site usage" {.smaller}
```{r example_det_hist_1}
### Original detection history
subset(JDR_det_hist_forpres, tag_code == "3D9.1BF1989388") %>% 
  remove_rownames() %>% dplyr::select(-c(tag_code, start_time))
```

```{r example_implicit}
### With implicit site usage
subset(JDR_states, tag_code == "3D9.1BF1989388") %>% 
  remove_rownames() %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(tag_code, run_year))
```

## Turning this into model probabilities {.smaller}
```{r model_probabilities}
subset(JDR_stepwise_probabilities, tag_code == "3D9.1BF1989388") %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(tag_code,date_time_1,date_time_2, pathway))

```
For writing out a multinomial likelihood statement, the probability of this detection history is:

$$
{p} = {o_{mcn}f_{mcn}o_{mcn}f_{mcn}h_{bonmcn}l_{nattrib}}
$$
Concern: Technically infinite possible combinations of parameters (though in the data a finite number are realized). Buchanon (2005) got around this by modeling each detection history as only upstream movement, with fallback/downstream movement events having an effect on upstream movement. 


## Accounting for repeat dam ascensions
1,118 of 2,121 John Day River wild steelhead overshot McNary Dam, and over a quarter of these individuals ascended McNary dam at least twice:
```{r overshoot_table}
kable(mcn_ascension_counts)
```


## Accounting for all fallback
```{r}
# Total individuals with known fallback over McNary
JDR_stepwise_probabilities %>% group_by(tag_code) %>% 
  filter(any(probability == "f_mcn"))  -> mcn_fallback

length(unique(mcn_fallback$tag_code))
```

```{r}
# Individuals that fell back, but did not home
JDR_stepwise_probabilities %>% group_by(tag_code) %>% 
  filter(any(probability == "f_mcn")) %>% 
  filter(!(any(probability == "h_bon_mcn"))) -> mcn_fallback_no_home

length(unique(mcn_fallback_no_home$tag_code))
```

## Detection probabilities
Detection probabilities are no longer estimated in the model, since we have corrected for known missed detections. Instead, they can be calculated outside of the model as (detected + implicit) / total.

NOTE: This is an overestimate of detection probability, because of unknown missed detections (undetermined loss).
```{r}
# Example: Detection probability of fallback routes at McNary
JDR_stepwise_probabilities %>% 
  subset(state_1 == "mainstem, MCN to ICH or PRA" & 
           state_2 == "mainstem, BON to MCN") -> JDR_MCN_fallbacks
# Detection probability of fallback
length(subset(JDR_MCN_fallbacks, pathway == 
                "MCN_fallback_arrays")$tag_code)/
  length(JDR_MCN_fallbacks$tag_code)
```


# Anomalous detection histories

## Iteroparous individuals {.smaller}

```{r iteroparous_1}
subset(JDR_det_hist_forpres, tag_code == "3D9.1C2C31C103") %>% 
  remove_rownames() %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(tag_code, start_time))
```

## Confusing arrays
- "LGRTAL - LGR - Release into the Tailrace within 0.5 km downstream of Dam"
  - I took this to be a site just downstream of LGR
- "LGRLDR - LGR - Release into the Adult Fish Ladder"
  - I took this to be a detection site in the adult fish ladder for the dam
  
- The Dalles, Lower Monumental, and Lower Goose - adult fish ladder detections seen frequently in detection history, but in Richins and Skalski (2018) they said that no PIT tag arrays were present at these sites.
