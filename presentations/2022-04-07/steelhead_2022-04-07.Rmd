# Modeling overview

## Previous approach: Multinomial likelihood
- Get a vector of probabilities *p* with length *K*, where *K* is the number of unique observed detection histories
- In the John Day River dataset, *K* = 169 (169 unique detection histories)
- Example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
n_{7} = f_{bon} * o_{bon} * f_{bon} * o_{bon} * h_{bon\_mcn} * l_{nat\_trib} \\
p[7] = n_{7}
\end{aligned}
$$


## Previous approach: Multinomial likelihood
```{r eval = FALSE}
p <- c(n1, n2, n3, ... n169)

# Evaluate counts, where y are the counts of 
# the number of times each of the unique detection 
# histories was observed

# 2121 are the number of fish
y[1:N] ~ dmulti(p[1:N], 2121)
```


## Multinomial likelihood no longer works with covariates
For fish *i* at location *l* at time *t*:
$$
\begin{aligned}
 \small \psi_{12}= f(temperature_{l,t}, origin_{i})
\end{aligned}
$$

- Each movement probability is different for each individual fish, depending on the unique combination of covariates that it is experiencing
- Therefore, a multinomial likelihood, or using an m-array approach to summarize detection histories, becomes untenable, or at least very complicated

## Moving to an individual-based model
```{r eval = FALSE}
for(i in 1:n.ind){ # Loop through all individuals
  for(j in 1:n.encounters){ # Loop through the encounters (detections)
    psi_12 <- f(origin[i], temperature[j])
    psi_13 <- f(origin[i], temperature[j])
    psi_14 <- f(origin[i], temperature[j])
    psi_1_loss <- 1 - psi_12 - psi_13 - psi_14
    
    # Likelihood: evaluate multinomial with single trial (categorical)
    
    # Get a vector of probabilities
    p <- c(psi_12, psi_13, psi_14)
    
    # y is an array, with dimensions (number of fish) X 
    # (number of possible states) X (number of encounters)
    
    # y[i,j,] is the vector containing all possible next states for a fish
    y[i,j,] ~ dmulti(p, 1)
  }
}
```


## Including covariates

- Enforcing sum to 1 constraint with covariates via the multinomial logit

<br />

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \small \psi_{12}=  \frac{\exp(\beta_{0,12} + \beta_{temp,12} * temp + \beta_{origin,12}[origin])}{1 + \exp(\beta_{0,12} + \beta_{temp,12} * temp + \beta_{origin,12}[origin]) + \\
 \exp(\beta_{0,13} + \beta_{temp,13} * temp + \beta_{origin,13}[origin]) + \\
 \exp(\beta_{0,14} + \beta_{temp,14} * temp + \beta_{origin,14}[origin])} \\
\end{aligned}
$$


## Detection probabilities - auxiliary likelihoods?

# New approach to covariate time window

## Old approach and issues:
- Old approach: Determine the median travel time from one dam to the next dam for each month and each natal origin; get the average value of the variable (e.g., temperature) for the weeklong window around that time
- This works well for upstream travel, but with downstream travel, we don't typically know when individuals entered states because of the low detection probability with downstream travel

- Our state-based model also doesn't assume the direction a fish is traveling when in a given state, so calculating a median travel time (either upstream or downstream) is problematic

## New approach:
- Calculate an "experience date", by using the time at arrival in state 1 and the time at arrival at state 2, which are typically known (e.g., the date + time that an individual was seen in the adult fish ladder at a dam)
- Calculate the time spent in this state as time at arrival in state 2  minus time at arrival in state 1
- Get the "experience date" by dividing the time spent in the state by 2 (this is equivalent to the median time in the state)

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
subset(states_times, tag_code == "3D9.1C2C509FE1") %>% 
  mutate(arrival_date = ymd(arrival_date)) %>% 
  subset(arrival_date >= as.POSIXct("2010-07-24") &
           arrival_date <= as.POSIXct("2010-09-22")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(tag_code, state_time, date_time, next_state, date_source)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(exp_date = date) %>% 
  # dplyr::rename(exp_date = date, arrival_date_time = date_time, arrival_date_source = date_source) %>% 
  remove_rownames() %>% 
  mutate(state = gsub("mainstem, ", "", state)) %>% 
  mutate(exp_date = ifelse(state == "MCN to ICH or PRA", NA, exp_date))
```

## New approach: {.smaller}
- If the arrival time in a state is not known (i.e., the site visit was implicit), then take the halfway point between two known site arrivals as the arrival time in the implicit state
- If there were N implicit site visits between known arrival times, divide the time between the two known arrival times by N+1 to estimate the time spent in each state

subset(states_times, tag_code == "3D9.1C2C509FE1") %>%

  mutate(state = gsub("mainstem, ", "", state))
```

## New approach: Full Example
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
subset(states_times, tag_code == "3D9.1C2C509FE1") %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(tag_code, date_source, date_time, next_state, state_time)) %>%

  dplyr::rename(exp_date = date) %>% 
  remove_rownames() %>% 
  mutate(state = gsub("mainstem, ", "", state))
```


## Indexing to covariate by state (location) and date
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
subset(states_times, tag_code == "3D9.1C2C509FE1") %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(tag_code, date_source, date_time, state_time, next_state)) %>% 
  # dplyr::rename(exp_date = date, arrival_date_time = date_time, arrival_date_source = date_source) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(exp_date = date) %>% 
  remove_rownames() %>% 
  mutate(state = gsub("mainstem, ", "", state)) %>% 
  mutate(exp_date = ymd(exp_date)) %>% 
  subset(exp_date >= as.POSIXct("2011-04-22") &
           exp_date <= as.POSIXct("2011-04-30"))

temp_by_state %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>% 
  subset(date >= as.POSIXct("2011-04-22") &
           date <= as.POSIXct("2011-04-30")) %>% 
  remove_rownames() %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c("mouth.to.BON", "MCN.to.ICH.or.PRA..ICH.", "MCN.to.ICH.or.PRA..PRA."))
```



## Problem: What to do at branching states?

MCN to PRA or ICH

- Two dams with covariate data at this state: PRA tailrace or ICH tailrace
- Potential solution could be to include the covariates (temperature, spill, flow) at both dams as covariates for just this state


## New potential covariate: time in a state
For individuals who are in the "mainstem, BON to MCN" state, how long does it take them to reach the next state?

![](.//figures/BON_MCN_map.png){width=100%}

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
subset(states_times, state == "mainstem, BON to MCN") %>% 
  subset(next_state != "mainstem, BON to MCN") %>% 
  group_by(next_state) %>% 
  summarise(median(state_time)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`median(state_time)`)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename("median time (days)" = `median(state_time)`)

weird_tags <- subset(states_times, state == "mainstem, BON to MCN" & next_state == "mainstem, BON to MCN")$tag_code

# subset(states_times, tag_code %in% weird_tags)
# There are some strange individuals where it's recording the same state twice? not sure what's going on there, need to fix it

# Some individuals also appear to be starting not in BON to MCN?
states_times %>% 
  group_by(tag_code) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  subset(state != "mainstem, BON to MCN") -> not_starting_in_BON_MCN
```

## Time in a state: directionality issue
### Individuals who just ascended BON

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Individuals who just ascended BON
states_times %>% 
  group_by(tag_code) %>% 
  # filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  subset(pathway == "BON (adult)") %>% 
  subset(state == "mainstem, BON to MCN") %>% 
  subset(next_state != "mainstem, BON to MCN") %>% 
  group_by(next_state) %>% 
  summarise(median(state_time)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`median(state_time)`)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename("median time (days)" = `median(state_time)`)
```


## Time in a state: directionality issue
### Individuals who did not just ascend BON

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Individuals who entered this state later
states_times %>% 
  group_by(tag_code) %>% 
  # filter(row_number() != 1) %>% 
  subset(pathway != "BON (adult)") %>% 
  subset(state == "mainstem, BON to MCN") %>% 
  subset(next_state != "mainstem, BON to MCN") %>% 
  group_by(next_state) %>% 
  summarise(median(state_time)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`median(state_time)`)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename("median time (days)" = `median(state_time)`)
```

Note: no individuals entered Hood River or Fifteenmile Creek next

## Missing covariate data
- How do we handle missing covariate data?
- Does missing covariate data indicate no flow?
