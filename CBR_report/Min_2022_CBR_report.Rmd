# Notes from Mark

I added a few options to the YAML to help with readability, but presumably you'll want to remove the line numbers on the version. Also I assume you're going to the include the `.bib` and `csl` files with the references and formatting template, respectively. For example,

# Introduction

Steelhead (anadromous *Oncorhynchus mykiss*) in the Columbia River Basin, including all those found above Bonneville Dam, are listed under the Endangered Species Act. The five Columbia River Basin distinct population segments (DPSs) were first listed in the late 1990s, and are all currently listed as threatened. Despite their protected status and continued recovery efforts, counts of returning Steelhead to Bonneville Dam are currently lower than they were at the time of listing, and recently completed 5-year reviews for Columbia River Steelhead reaffirmed their status as threatened.

Relative to other salmonids, Steelhead from the Columbia River Basin spend longer in freshwater as adults. Essentially all populations of Steelhead in the Columbia River Basin are stream-maturing [@Busby1996], meaning that these fish enter freshwater in a sexually immature state and then spend up to a year in freshwater prior to spawning. Also known as summer Steelhead, these fish enter freshwater between May and October and spawn the following spring, typically between March and April [@Busby1996]. Between their entry into freshwater and arrival at spawning grounds, Columbia River Steelhead exhibit considerable variability in their migration patterns. All Columbia River Steelhead overwinter in freshwater; the majority of individuals are known to overwinter in tributaries, but up to 20% of individuals in a given year have been observed to overwinter within the hydrosystem [@Keefer2008]. Additionally, as individuals migrate upstream toward natal tributaries, the majority of individuals have been observed to temporarily stage in nonnatal tributaries downstream of their natal tributary [@High2006]. This behavior increases with increasing mainstem river temperature, indicating the use of these colder waters as coldwater refugia [@High2006].

Descending dams, also known as fallback [@Boggs2004], is another common behavior observed in Steelhead, with about 20% of Steelhead observed to fall back over at at least one mainstem dam [@Boggs2004]. This behavior can occur as individuals are migrating upstream to natal tributaries, but can also occur once individuals have ascended mainstem dams upstream of natal tributaries (a behavior known as overshoot), in which case this fallback is called post-overshoot fallback and is necessary for individuals to return to natal tributaries. Overshoot and fallback affect the ability of individuals to successfully spawn, and therefore are consequential for the persistence of ESA-listed populations. Individuals that fall back during their upstream migration are less likely to return to their natal tributaries or hatcheries [@Bjornn2000; @Keefer2005]. Furthermore, migration success to natal tributaries decreases with overshooting rates [@Richins2018], and many overshooting fish are observed to stray to tributaries upstream of the overshoot dam.

The decreased migration success associated with overshoot and fallback is likely due to the hazardous nature of downstream passage for adults, which is often limited to the powerhouse during the primary months that Steelhead are overwintering [@Khan2013]. Mortality rates for Steelhead passing downstream at dams are highly variable, but recent estimates of 48-hour survival at McNary Dam indicate around 90% survival for individuals passing through turbines and 97% survival for individuals passing through the spillway [@Normandeau2014]. Mortality in downstream passage routes is implicated by low survival rates of Steelhead kelts, which decrease with increasing number of dams that must be navigated as they move downstream to the ocean, with mortality rates of 84-96% for kelts released at Lower Granite Dam, 38-40% at McNary Dam, and 20-37% at John Day Dam [@Westrheim2005].

Because of the association between overshoot and fallback and decreased migration success, previous studies have investigated the influence of various factors on these rates. Rates of overshoot have been shown to vary considerably among populations, but have a positive relationship with increasing mainstem water temperature and hatchery rearing upstream of the natal tributary [@Richins2018]. In spring-summer Chinook, fallback rates have a positive relationship with river discharge [@Boggs2004]. (_MDS: I would add a sentence or two here with the objectives of this study._)


# Methods

## Accessing PIT tag data

PIT tag data were obtained from PTAGIS (_MDS: spell out PTAGIS on first mention._). Only known-origin individuals (based on known release sites) were included in this dataset. To ensure that only individuals marked as juveniles were kept in the dataset, all individuals that were greater than 350 mm at time of marking were removed. To select returning adults, only individuals that were seen in the adult fishways at Bonneville Dam were selected. To ensure that there was enough data for each population included in this dataset, only populations (defined as tributaries in which PIT-tagged juveniles were released) that had at least 250 individuals distributed across 8 run years were kept. Additionally, only populations with instream PIT tag detections sites in their natal tributaries were kept; if sufficient instream detection sites only became available during the later part of our study period, only individuals from those years were kept. Run years were separated by June 1 of each year, and run year 2005/2006 (beginning on June 1, 2005) was selected as the first year in our dataset. In total, populations from 17 natal tributaries met this criteria; 11 tributaries of the Columbia (Deschutes River, John Day River, Hood River, Fifteenmile Creek, Umatilla River, Yakima River, Walla Walla River, Wenatchee River, Entiat River, Okanogan River, and Methow River) and six tributaries of the Snake (Tucannon River, Asotin Creek, Clearwater River, Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, and Imnaha River). Once the tag codes were identified for each of these tributary populations, a complete tag history report was run in PTAGIS for all of the tag codes in our dataset.

## Processing PIT tag data into detections at various sites

In order to convert detections of fish at individual PIT tag antennas into a history of movements between different reaches of the Columbia, Snake, and their tributaries, the first step with the PIT tag data from PTAGIS was to interpret detections at different PIT tag antennas. For instream tributary detection sites, as well as mainstem sites in between dams, no processing was required, and these detections were interpreted as the fish being in that associated state. For detection sites at dams, additional processing was required to interpret detections.

The first step was to identify the multiple passage routes associated with each dam. In many cases, multiple passage routes were grouped together into a single interrogation site, and assigning antennas to these different passage routes was necessary to interpret how fish were utilizing these passage routes. For example, antennas at Ice Harbor Dam are all grouped together in the initial PTAGIS query as "Ice Harbor Dam (combined)", when these antennas are actually in three different passage routes: the North Shore Ladder, the South Shore Ladder, and the Juvenile Bypass System.

The second step was to identify, when possible, entrance and exit antennas within each upstream passage route. Entrance and exit antennas were only distinguished when either two distinct groupings of antennas existed in separate parts of the same passage route, or in the case of Bonneville Dam, when there are enough consecutive weirs with PIT tag detection antennas to separate these weirs into entrance and exit antennas. By distinguishing entrance and exit antennas, we were able to identify when fish detections in adult fishways were not ascents, but were rather aborted ascent attempts or descents. When fish were only seen at entrance antennas, this was noted to be an aborted ascension attempt. When fish were first seen at the exit antennas at an adult fish ladder and last seen at the entrance antennas of the same fish ladder, this was noted to be a descent through the ladder. If a fish was first seen at the entrance antennas and last seen at the exit antennas, this was noted to be an ascent. Entrance and exit antennas were identified at all adult fishways except for McNary Dam Washington Shore Ladder (prior to March 2006), Priest Rapids Dam, Rock Island Dam, Rocky Reach Dam, Wells Dam (prior to 2013), and Ice Harbor Dam.

For most dams, detections in the adult fish facility were treated the same as detections in other parts of the adult ladder, as trapping did not take place and thus fish were not removed. However, in the case of Wells Dam, fish that were trapped were removed and either moved to the hatchery or trucked off-site. As such, any terminal detections in the trap at Wells Dam were treated as trapping events.

Once the antennas had been appropriately assigned, a 48 hour threshold was utilized to distinguish separate visits to a site. However, in some passage routes, due to fish being observed in the same route for days at a time, no time threshold was utilized, and instead the sequence of antennas was used to distinguish separate visits to a site. For example, because individual fish were observed not exiting the Washington shore passage route at Bonneville Dam for upwards of 100 days, new visits to this site were only distinguished as new visits to the entrance antennas, regardless of time between detections at other antennas in the passage route.


## Turning detections at different sites into state visits

With antennas appropriately assigned to different passage routes and the sequence of antenna detections used at the adult fishways to interpret directionality, the output from the previous script was used as input into the next script, which converted a history of detections at sites into a history of movements between states, as defined in Figure 1. For instream detection sites in either the mainstem or the tributaries, detections at these sites were interpreted as the fish being in the appropriate state. For detections at sites in the fish passage routes at dams, the directionality of movement, as assigned in the previous script, was used to inform transitions between states. Ascents at dams indicated a transition from the downstream state to the upstream state; descents at dams (either through the juvenile bypass system or through descents through the ladder) indicated a transition from the upstream state to the downstream state. Aborted ascension attempts were noted, but interpreted as no transition from the current state.

Until the installation of the PIT tag antennas in the spillway at Lower Granite Dam in 2020, PIT tag detection capabilities were limited to the adult fish ladders and the juvenile bypass system at each dam. As such, PIT tag antennas have historically been unable to directly monitor fallback at dams, unless an individual subsequently reascends the dam [@Boggs2004]. With the installation of instream antennas in natal tributaries, fallback to home has been monitored [@Richins2018], by noting when individuals entered natal tributaries downstream of a dam that was previously ascended. In this study, we monitored fallback to the greatest extent possible with the current configuration of PIT tag antennas by using our knowledge of the connections between states in our model to note when downstream movements must have occurred. In this way, we included fallback that occurred on the mainstem downstream of the natal tributary (similar to [@Boggs2004]), fallback to home (similar to [@Richins2018]), and other fallback movements, such as fallback upstream of the natal tributary that did not end in homing.

Once we determined a history of movement between states, we then subset this movement history to eliminate any movement that occurred as a juvenile or as a kelt, in order to isolate only the portion of the adult migration prior to reaching spawning areas. Juvenile history was identified as any detections within 90 days of release or on or before June 15 of the release year. Kelt movement was identified as any downstream movement occurring between March and July (following spawning). Repeat spawners were also identified in the dataset based on detections at the Bonneville adult ladders occurring at least 180 days after they were initially seen at Bonneville. For the purposes of our analysis, repeat spawners were treated as new fish when they returned to Bonneville.

## The model in stan
![The model schematic.](.//figures/full_model_diagram.jpg){width=100%}

The history of state transitions for each individual PIT-tagged fish, as well as the information on that fish's natal origin, were the inputs for the multistate model. The multistate model was implemented in a Bayesian framework using the Stan programming language [@Carpenter2017]. The multistate model is constructed as a series of states, defined as either reaches of the mainstem Columbia or Snake Rivers between dams with active PIT tag antennas for the duration of our study period or tributaries that flow into the Columbia or Snake Rivers (Figure 1). All fish in our model begin when they are first detected as adults in the fish ladders at Bonneville Dam. At each state in our model, each fish is assigned a probability of moving to any of the states connected to the current states. This probability is evaluated through a multinomial logit.

(_MDS: This would be a good place to add/introduce the actual equations._)

Due to the computational requirements of evaluating the detection histories of over 60,000 individual fish, the model was fit to three different datasets, corresponding to the three Steelhead DPSs found exclusively upstream of Bonneville Dam: the Middle Columbia DPS, the Upper Columbia DPS, and the Snake River Basin DPS. To reduce the number of parameters in the model,
