# Executive summary

Columbia River Steelhead, who spend more time as adults in freshwater than any other salmonid in the basin, have notoriously complex adult migration pathways, characterized frequently by indirect pathways home, overshooting natal tributaries, and falling back over and through hydroelectric dams. Previous studies have characterized specific movements of interest (i.e., overshoot and fallback) and examined the effect of some factors on these movements, but have not presented a comprehensive view of the adult Steelhead migration.

<br>

Here, we present a progress update on a new modeling framework that is capable of modeling the entire adult migration of Steelhead, including upstream movements, downstream movements, and movements into tributaries. This modeling framework translates the Columbia River Basin into a series of interconnected states, each representing a reach of the mainstem Columbia or Snake River between hydroelectric dams or a tributary that flows into them. We converted detections of over 60,000 Steelhead from each of the hundreds of PIT tag detection sites in the Columbia River Basin into a sequence of state visits for each fish, and fit a Bayesian multistate model to this data using the Stan programming language. This model also uses the network of PIT tag antennas in each tributary to correct for detection efficiency in each of these tributaries. From this model, we generate movement probabilities for fish from each of 17 different natal origins (tributaries), including probabilities of homing, fallback, and overshoot.

<br>

With the current model configuration, we were able to generate estimates of the probability of key movements for different populations. For example, we were able to determine which populations had high overshooting rates (e.g., John Day River, Umatilla River, Entiat River, Wenatchee River, and Walla Walla River Steelhead) and that for Wenatchee River Steelhead, overshoot was particularly detrimental: Wenatchee River Steelhead that did not overshoot had a four times higher probability of making it home than did those that did. 

<br>

Work on this model is ongoing. The model's primary strength is that it is highly flexible it can simultaneously account for and parse apart the effect of many different covariates, including flow, spill, temperature, hatchery rearing practices, and juvenile barging. In future configurations of the model, these covariates will be included to address questions such as how winter spill affects fallback, how temperature affects overshooting, and how hatchery rearing practices such as juvenile acclimation affects decisions that these fish make as adults.



# Introduction

Steelhead (anadromous *Oncorhynchus mykiss*) in the Columbia River Basin, including all those found above Bonneville Dam, are listed under the Endangered Species Act. The five Columbia River Basin distinct population segments (DPSs) were first listed in the late 1990s, and are all currently listed as threatened. Despite their protected status and continued recovery efforts, counts of returning Steelhead to Bonneville Dam have been lower in the last five years than they were at the time of listing, and recently completed 5-year reviews for Columbia River Steelhead reaffirmed their status as threatened [@NMFS2022; @NMFS2022a; @NMFS2022b; @NMFS2022c].

<br>

One element of the life history of Columbia River Basin Steelhead that may make them more vulnerable to anthropogenic modifications of the Columbia River is their adult migration. Relative to other salmonids, Steelhead from the Columbia River Basin spend longer in freshwater as adults. Essentially all populations of Steelhead in the Columbia River Basin are stream-maturing [@Busby1996], meaning that these fish enter freshwater in a sexually immature state and then spend up to a year in freshwater prior to spawning. Also known as summer Steelhead, these fish enter freshwater between May and October and spawn the following spring, typically between March and May [@Busby1996]. Between their entry into freshwater and arrival at spawning grounds, Columbia River Steelhead exhibit considerable variability in their migration patterns. Virtually all interior Columbia River Steelhead overwinter in freshwater; the majority of individuals are known to overwinter in tributaries, but up to 20% of individuals in a given year have been observed to overwinter in the hydrosystem, which comprises of the mainstem habitat between the 10 hydroelectric dams in the federal Columbia River power system [@Keefer2008]. Additionally, as individuals migrate upstream toward natal tributaries, the majority of individuals have been observed to temporarily stage in nonnatal tributaries downstream of their natal tributary [@High2006]. This behavior increases with increasing mainstem river temperature, indicating the use of these colder waters as coldwater refugia [@High2006]. These highly variable movement patterns and increased duration in freshwater make Steelhead more vulnerable to the hazards faced in freshwater.

<br>

Descending dams, also known as fallback [@Boggs2004], is another common behavior observed in Steelhead, with about 20% of Steelhead observed to fall back over at at least one mainstem dam [@Boggs2004]. This behavior can occur as individuals are migrating upstream to natal tributaries, but can also occur once individuals have ascended mainstem dams upstream of natal tributaries (a behavior known as overshoot), in which case this fallback is called post-overshoot fallback and is necessary for individuals to return to natal tributaries. Overshoot and fallback affect the ability of individuals to successfully spawn, and therefore are consequential for the persistence of ESA-listed populations. Individuals that fall back during their upstream migration (prior to reaching or overshooting their natal tributary) are less likely to return to their natal tributaries or hatcheries [@Bjornn2000; @Keefer2005]. Furthermore, migration success to natal tributaries decreases with overshooting rates [@Richins2018], and many overshooting fish are observed to stray to tributaries upstream of the overshoot dam.

<br>

The decreased migration success associated with overshoot and fallback is likely due to the hazardous nature of downstream passage for adults, which is often limited to the powerhouse during the primary months that Steelhead are overwintering [@Khan2013]. Mortality rates for adult Steelhead passing downstream at dams are highly variable, but recent estimates of 48-hour survival at McNary Dam indicate around 90% survival for individuals passing through turbines and 97% survival for individuals passing through the spillway [@Associates2014]. Mortality in downstream passage routes is implicated by low survival rates of Steelhead kelts, which decrease with increasing number of dams that must be navigated as they move downstream to the ocean, with mortality rates of 84-96% for kelts released at Lower Granite Dam, 38-40% at McNary Dam, and 20-37% at John Day Dam [@Wertheimer2005].

<br>

Because of the association between overshoot and fallback and decreased migration success, previous studies have investigated the influence of various factors on these rates. Rates of overshoot have been shown to vary considerably among populations, but have a positive relationship with increasing mainstem water temperature and hatchery rearing upstream of the natal tributary [@Richins2018]. In spring-summer Chinook, fallback rates have a positive relationship with river discharge [@Boggs2004]. However, these previous studies have looked at these various factors only in isolation and for specific movements. In this study, we developed a multistate model that is capable of modeling the entire adult Steelhead migration, from first detection at Bonneville Dam to arrival in natal tributaries. This model, which does not constrain movement to only be upstream, allows the complex, multidirectional movement of adult Steelhead to be modeled in full and allows many movements of interest, including fallback, overshoot, and homing, to be estimated in a single framework. The data used in this model were passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag detection histories. This modeling framework is capable of accommodating the effect of multiple categorical and continuous covariates at movement probabilities at each step within the migration. By examining how Steelhead movement probabilities, particularly those of conservation concern, such as overshoot, fallback, homing, and straying, vary by population and are influenced by various factors, this modeling framework will improve our understanding of how both environmental and anthropogenically influenced conditions affect how Steelhead move within the Columbia River and its tributaries.

## Preparing data

### Accessing PIT tag data

PIT tag data were obtained from the Columbia Basin PIT Tag Information System (PTAGIS). Only known-origin individuals (based on known release sites) were included in this dataset. To ensure that only individuals marked as juveniles were kept in the dataset, all individuals that were greater than 350 mm at time of marking were removed. To select returning adults, only individuals that were seen in the adult fishways at Bonneville Dam were selected. To ensure that there were enough data for each population included in this dataset, only populations (defined as tributaries in which PIT-tagged juveniles were released) that had at least 250 individuals distributed across 8 run years were kept. Additionally, only populations with instream PIT tag detections sites in their natal tributaries were kept; if sufficient instream detection sites only became available during the later part of our study period, only individuals from those years were kept. Run years were separated by June 1 of each year, and run year 2005/2006 (beginning on June 1, 2005) was selected as the first year in our dataset. In total, populations from 17 natal tributaries met this criteria: 11 tributaries of the Columbia (Deschutes River, John Day River, Hood River, Fifteenmile Creek, Umatilla River, Yakima River, Walla Walla River, Wenatchee River, Entiat River, Okanogan River, and Methow River) and six tributaries of the Snake (Tucannon River, Asotin Creek, Clearwater River, Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, and Imnaha River). Once the tag codes were identified for each of these tributary populations, a complete tag history report was run in PTAGIS for all of the tag codes in our dataset.

### Processing PIT tag data into detections at various sites

To convert detections of fish at individual PIT tag antennas into a history of movements between different reaches of the Columbia, Snake, and their tributaries, it was first necessary to interpret detections at different PIT tag antennas. For instream tributary detection sites, as well as mainstem sites in between dams, no processing was required, and these detections were interpreted as the fish being in that associated state. For detection sites at dams, additional processing was required to interpret detections.

<br>

The first step in interpreting detections at dams was to identify the multiple passage routes associated with each dam. In many cases, multiple passage routes were grouped together into a single interrogation site, and assigning antennas to these different passage routes was necessary to interpret how fish were utilizing these passage routes. For example, antennas at Ice Harbor Dam are all grouped together in PTAGIS as "Ice Harbor Dam (combined)", when these antennas are actually in three different passage routes: the North Shore Ladder, the South Shore Ladder, and the Juvenile Bypass System.

<br>

The second step was to identify, when possible, entrance and exit antennas within each upstream passage route. By distinguishing entrance and exit antennas, we were able to identify when fish detections in adult fishways were not ascents, but were rather aborted ascent attempts or descents. Entrance and exit antennas were only distinguished when either two distinct groupings of antennas existed in separate parts of the same passage route, or in the case of Bonneville Dam, when there are enough consecutive weirs with PIT tag detection antennas to separate these weirs into entrance and exit antennas. When fish were only seen at entrance antennas, this was noted to be an aborted ascension attempt. When fish were first seen at the exit antennas at an adult fish ladder and last seen at the entrance antennas of the same fish ladder, this was noted to be a descent through the ladder. If a fish was first seen at the entrance antennas and last seen at the exit antennas, this was noted to be an ascent. Entrance and exit antennas were identified at all adult fishways except for McNary Dam Washington Shore Ladder (prior to March 2006), Priest Rapids Dam, Rock Island Dam, Rocky Reach Dam, Wells Dam (prior to 2013), and Ice Harbor Dam.

<br>

Additionally, we identified antennas in adult fish facilities/traps at ladders. For most dams, we treated detections in the adult fish facility the same as detections in other parts of the adult ladder, as adults were not removed (e.g., Ice Harbor Dam, Priest Rapids Dam, or Lower Granite Dam, where traps were operated but adults were returned after processing). However, in the case of Wells Dam, trapped fish were either moved to the hatchery or trucked off-site. As such, any terminal detections in the trap at Wells Dam were classified as terminal trapping events, and were classified as fish moving to the absorbing "loss" state.

<br>

Once the antennas had been appropriately assigned, a 48-hour threshold was used to distinguish separate visits to a site. However, in some passage routes fish were observed in the same route for days at a time, so no time threshold was set, and instead we used the sequence of antennas to distinguish separate visits to a site. For example, some individual fish did not exit the Washington shore passage route at Bonneville Dam for upwards of 100 days, so new visits to this site were only distinguished by new visits to the entrance antennas, regardless of time between detections at other antennas in the passage route.

### Turning detections at different sites into state visits

With antennas appropriately assigned to different passage routes and the sequence of antenna detections at the adult fishways used to interpret directionality, the output from the previous script was used as input into the next script, which converted a history of detections at sites into a history of movements between states, as defined in Fig. 2. For detections at sites in the fish passage routes at dams, the directionality of movement, as assigned in the previous script, was used to inform transitions between states. Ascents at dams indicated a transition from the downstream state to the upstream state; descents at dams (either through the juvenile bypass system or through descents through the ladder) indicated a transition from the upstream state to the downstream state. Aborted ascension attempts were noted, but interpreted as no transition from the current state. Detections in tributary sites were interpreted as transitions from the mainstem state into the tributary. Once a fish transitioned into a given state, any subsequent detections in that state were ignored, as they did represent transitions between states. Therefore, if fish were detected at sites within the same tributary consecutively, or if fish were detected at instream sites in the mainstem following transition into that mainstem state, these detections were ignored.

<br>

With the exception of a few downstream routes, such as the spillway at Lower Granite Dam following the installation of the PIT tag antennas in 2020, or the Bonneville Corner Collector, PIT tag detection capabilities were limited to the adult fish ladders and the juvenile bypass system at each dam. As such, PIT tag antennas have historically been unable to directly monitor fallback at dams, unless an individual subsequently reascends the dam [@Boggs2004]. With the installation of instream antennas in natal tributaries, fallback to home has been monitored [@Richins2018], by noting when individuals entered natal tributaries downstream of a dam that was previously ascended. In this study, we monitored fallback to the greatest extent possible with the current configuration of PIT tag antennas by using our knowledge of the connections between states in our model to note when downstream movements must have occurred. In this way, we included fallback that occurred on the mainstem downstream of the natal tributary (similar to [@Boggs2004]), fallback to home (similar to [@Richins2018]), and other fallback movements, such as fallback upstream of the natal tributary that did not end in homing.

<br>

Once we determined a history of movement between states, we then subset this movement history to eliminate any movement that occurred as a juvenile or as a kelt in order to isolate only the portion of the adult migration prior to reaching spawning areas. Based on manual inspection of detection histories, juvenile movements were identified using the following criteria: (1) any detections within 90 days of juvenile release; (2) any detections on or before June 15 of the the same year that an individual was released, or detections on or before June 15 in a given year if individual was released on or after July 1 of the previous year. The June 15 cutoff date was chosen based on the timing of juvenile outmigration at Bonneville Dam, 95% of which occurs before this date in nearly every run year (data from CBR DART). Kelt movement was identified as any downstream movement occurring between March and July (following spawning). Repeat spawners were also identified in the dataset based on detections at the Bonneville adult ladders occurring at least 180 days after they were initially seen at Bonneville. For the purposes of our analysis, repeat spawners were treated as new fish when they returned to Bonneville.

## Statistical methods
![Figure 2. The model schematic.](.//figures/full_model_diagram.jpg){width=100%}

In our model, the Columbia River and its tributaries are modeled as a series of connected states, with states defined as either reaches of the mainstem Columbia or Snake River between dams with PIT tag detection capabilities in the adult ladders or tributaries with PIT tag detectors. Fig. 2 shows all of the states in our model; movements over some dams (e.g., The Dalles or John Day Dams) were not explicitly modeled due to these dams not having PIT tag detection capabilities for the duration of our study period. Future iterations of the model could be configured to include these dams for part of the time series by splitting state 2 (mainstem, Bonneville Dam to McNary Dam) into three states: (1) mainstem, Bonneville Dam to The Dalles Dam; (2) mainstem, The Dalles Dam to John Day Dam; and (3) mainstem, John Day Dam to McNary Dam. This would allow the estimation of fallback and overshoot at The Dalles Dam and John Day Dam (which would be of particular interest to populations near these dams, such as the Deschutes River or Fifteenmile Creek), but would require a temporally-varying state configuration. 

<br>

An additional state in our model not shown in the schematic, but which can be reached from any state, is the absorbing "loss" state, which a fish enters once the detection history ends. Once a fish has entered the loss state, it can no longer leave it. Movements into the loss state are either mortality (via natural mortality, harvest, mortality due to the hydrosystem, etc.) or unobserved movements out of the state, which could be due to missed detections at PIT tag antennas, movements into areas without PIT tag detectors (e.g., certain tributaries), or movements into tributaries that failed to reach PIT tag antennas.

### Modeling detection efficiency in tributaries

Over the course of our study period, the network of PIT tag detection arrays in tributaries was highly dynamic, as antennas were installed, decommissioned, and upgraded. From 2010 to 2018, the number of tag detection arrays in tributaries almost tripled [@Morrisett2018], and in some years of our study, the tributaries in our model had no active antennas at all [@Richins2017]. As a consequence, our ability to detect fish entering these tributaries varied considerably both temporally and spatially (between tributaries).

<br>

To address this, we estimated detection efficiency in tributaries by calculating the detection efficiency at the PIT tag detection site closest to the river mouth (i.e., the confluence of the tributary with either the Columbia or Snake River). We estimated detection efficiency by taking the individuals that were seen at detection sites upstream of the river mouth site and calculating what proportion were seen at the river mouth site. For 14 of the 17 tributaries in our model (Table 1), we identified a PIT tag detection site on the mainstem tributary suitable for calculating detection efficiency; three tributaries (the Clearwater River, Salmon River, and Grande Ronde River) lacked a suitable site and therefore detection efficiency was not calculated for these tributaries.

<br>

In our estimation of detection efficiency, we included two covariates: (1) a categorical covariate representing different antenna configurations, and (2) a covariate for the effect of discharge. Different categorical covariates were chosen based on the operational history of each interrogation site. We identified major changes in site configuration which were likely to have affected the detection efficiency at these sites, such as the installation of new antennas, arrays being moved, or components being upgraded. The years in which these changes occurred were then used to inform which categorical covariate for antenna configuration was used. We chose to include discharge as a covariate for detection efficiency as well because of the relationship between discharge and river stage, which affects the volume of the river covered by the range of the antennas (see Fig. 3 for an example). Discharge data was queried from USGS by finding the station on the [interactive USGS dashboard](https://dashboard.waterdata.usgs.gov/app/nwd/lang-en/?aoi=default) closest the river mouth array and navigating to the data page for the specific site. Discharge data was available for all tributaries except Fifteenmile Creek and the Imnaha River; these tributaries therefore had detection efficiency estimated only via the categorical covariate (intercept) for antenna configuration.

Detection efficiency was then estimated using a logistic regression, with detection a function of an intercept, for the categorical covariate of site configuration, and a slope term (unique to each tributary) multiplied by the mean discharge in that run year.
\usepackage{amsmath}

$$
z_{i} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_{i})
$$
$$
\text{logit}(p_i)=\alpha_{j, k}  +  \beta_{j}  discharge_{j,t}
$$

In this equation, $z$ is whether or not an individual fish was detected (0 or 1), $p$ is the probability of detection, $\alpha$ is the categorical covariate for site configuration, and $\beta$ is the slope for the effect of discharge on the probability of detection efficiency.

The indices represent the following:

- $i$ is the individual fish
- $j$ is the tributary
- $k$ is the site configuration (a categorical variable)
- $t$ is the run year

A Stan [@Carpenter2017] model was used to estimate detection probability in each tributary. Discharge values were Z-scored prior to the model being fit. The posteriors from this model for each of the $\alpha$ (site configuration covariates) and $\beta$ (effect of discharge) terms were used as priors in the primary Stan model that was used to estimate movement. The fit for detection efficiency can be found in Appendix 1.

### Movement model

The history of state transitions for each individual PIT-tagged fish, as well as the information on that fish's natal origin, were the inputs for the current configuration of multistate model. The multistate model was implemented in a Bayesian framework using the Stan programming language [@Carpenter2017]. The multistate model is constructed as a series of states, defined as either reaches of the mainstem Columbia or Snake Rivers between dams with active PIT tag antennas for the duration of our study period or tributaries that flow into the Columbia or Snake Rivers (Fig. 3). All fish in our model begin when they are first detected as adults in the fish ladders at Bonneville Dam. At each state in our model, each fish is assigned a probability of moving to any of the states connected to the current states, or into the absorbing loss category, which a fish enters once the detection history ends. Each of these probabilities is evaluated through a categorical logit, with an intercept term (a grand mean, for all fish in the dataset) as well as a term for the origin of the fish. The loss probability calculated as 1 - the sum of the other probabilities, enforcing a constraint that all movement probabilities have to sum to 1.

<br>

Due to the computational requirements of evaluating the detection histories of over 60,000 individual fish, the model was fit to three different datasets, corresponding to the three Steelhead DPSs found exclusively upstream of Bonneville Dam: the Middle Columbia DPS, the Upper Columbia DPS, and the Snake River Basin DPS. To reduce the number of parameters in the model, an effect of natal origin was only included for state transitions into or out of states within the DPS boundaries, whereas for states outside of the DPS, all origins shared a common movement probability. This model structure allowed different natal origins to differentiate as they neared natal tributaries. All code is available at https://github.com/markusmin/steelhead.

<br>

For each observation of a fish in a state, there are $n$ possible non-loss transitions out of the current state, which correspond to the number of arrows out of the state as seen in Fig. 2. The probability of moving to each of the $n$ states is given as follows:

<br> 

for (i in 1:n):
$$
p_i = \frac{exp(b_{0,i} + b_{origin,i})}{1 + exp(b_{0,1} + b_{origin,1}) + exp(b_{0,2} + b_{origin,2}) + ... exp(b_{0,n} + b_{origin,n})}
$$
<br>

The loss term is given by the following equation:
$$
p_{loss} = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i
$$

<br> 

This generates a vector of probabilities, corresponding to the movement probability from the current state to each of the connecting states. At this point, the detection efficiency correction is implemented for all transitions for which we can calculate a detection efficiency, to estimate the observed movement probabilities from the true vector of movement probabilities. Given that for almost every tributary, detection efficiency could not be calculated for every year, the first step was to identify which connecting states had the ability to estimate detection efficiency in the year in which the transition occurred. For each of the transitions for which a detection efficiency could then be calculated, the following correction was made: 

First, the detection efficiency of that tributary in that year, with that year's mean discharge, was estimated:

$$
p_{detection,j,t} = exp(\alpha_{j, k}  +  \beta_{j}  discharge_{j,t})/(1 + exp(\alpha_{j, k}  +  \beta_{j}  discharge_{j,t}))
$$

Next, the probability of the corresponding transition in the vector of observed transitions was adjusted:
$$
p_{obs,j} = p_{actual,j} * p_{detection,j,t}
$$

Since any transitions that were unobserved but occurred would appear as fish moving to the absorbing loss category, this term was also adjuted accordingly:
$$
p_{obs,loss} = p_{actual, loss} + p_{actual,j} * (1 - p_{detection,j,t})
$$


With the vector of observed transition probabilities generated, the transition is evaluated as follows:
$$
z_{t+1} \sim \text{categorical}(p_{obs,1}, p_{obs,2}, p_{obs,3} ... p_{obs, n})
$$

<br>

In these equations, $p_{detection}$ is the probability of detection, $p_{actual}$ is the vector which contains the true movement probabilities, $p_{obs}$ is the vector which contains the observed movement probabilities, $\alpha$ is the categorical covariate for site configuration, $\beta$ is the slope for the effect of discharge on the probability of detection efficiency, and $z$ is the next observation of the fish. The indices represent the following:

- $j$ is the tributary
- $k$ is the site configuration (a categorical variable)
- $t$ is the run year

### Derived model probabilities

#### Final population distribution (final fates)

From the movement probabilities estimated by the model, we estimated the probability of fish ending in each state in the model. This was done via a simulation approach, where for each natal origin, one million fish of that origin started in the state directly upstream of Bonneville Dam. The simulation then ran forward in time, selecting the next state of each fish based on the model-derived probabilities of movement, until each fish entered the loss state. The state directly prior to the loss state was recorded as the "final fate" of the fish, and the proportion of fish that ended in each state was calculated. Credible intervals were generated for these final fates by re-running the simulation with each of the MCMC draws for each parameter, with the 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles of the final fates presented.

#### Homing probabilities, conditional on overshoot

To assess the effect of overshooting on overall success, as defined by the final fate of a fish being its natal tributary, the simulation approach outlined above was similarly implemented, but with a different starting state. The probability of homing was compared for fish which started in the state that connected to the home tributary and for fish which started in the first overshoot state. The probability of ending up in the home tributary was then estimated in each of these simulations and compared to estimate the effect of overshooting on homing ability.

Snake River Basin Steelhead were generally more often seen in the Upper Columbia (upstream of Priest Rapids Dam) than Upper Columbia Steelhead were seen in the Snake River (upstream of Ice Harbor Dam). Middle Columbia Steelhead, especially Walla Walla River Steelhead, were seen in either the Snake River or the Upper Columbia very frequently; these fish were individuals that overshot their home tributary.

<br>

Overshooting was most frequently observed in John Day River Steelhead (55% overshooting rate at McNary Dam), Umatilla River Steelhead (40% overshooting rate at McNary Dam), Wenatchee River Steelhead (47% overshooting rate at Rocky Reach Dam), Entiat River Steelhead (35% overshooting rate at Wells Dam), and Walla Walla River Steelhead (52% overshooting rate at Ice Harbor Dam). Two populations were observed to overshoot at least two dams at greater than a 20% rate: Walla Walla River Steelhead (Ice Harbor Dam and Lower Granite Dam) and Wenatchee River Steelhead (Rocky Reach Dam and Wells Dam). Middle Columbia Steelhead tended to overshoot at Ice Harbor Dam more frequently than at Priest Rapids Dam, with the exception of Yakima River Steelhead, which can be explained by the Yakima River confluence with the Columbia River being upstream of the confluence of the Columbia and Snake Rivers.

Fallback at dams was not observed directly, but rather was inferred by the remainder of the detection history. Due to detection efficiency in fallback routes being less than one, but also not estimable, these are lower bound estimates of fallback. Many natal origins had high proportions of individuals falling back over at least one dam. More than 20% of John Day River Steelhead, Umatilla River Steelhead, and Entiat River Steelhead, had at least one known fallback event. By dam, McNary Dam had the highest number of fish observed to fall back over it (2,480), followed by Lower Granite Dam (1,440), Ice Harbor Dam (1,184), and Bonneville Dam (1,148).

## Final population distribution probability

### Middle Columbia River Steelhead

Yakima River, Umatilla River, and Deschutes River Steelhead each had median homing probabilities of over 0.5, with Yakima River Steelhead having the highest homing probability of any of the six Middle Columbia Steelhead tributaries, with a median homing probability of 0.77. On the contrary, Fifteenmile Creek, John Day River, and Walla Walla River Steelhead all had median homing probabilities below 0.4. Fifteenmile Creek Steelhead actually had a higher median probability of ending up in the Deschutes River (0.44) than in Fifteenmile Creek (0.27).

### Upper Columbia River Steelhead

Wenatchee River Steelhead only had a roughly 1/3 probability of homing successfully, whereas the other three origins had median homing probabilities between 0.4 and 0.6. There was a 0.03 - 0.04 median probability of straying to the Methow River for the other three origins, whereas Methow River Steelhead had a 0.05 probability of straying to the Okanogan River. The probability of straying to any other tributary was nearly zero, except for the Deschutes River, which had a probability around 0.01.

### Snake River Basin Steelhead

Because three of the six Snake River tributaries could not be corrected for detection efficiency, homing probabilities for these three tributaries (the Clearwater River, Grande Ronde River, and Salmon River) are biased low. Fish from these three natal origins each had a median probability of last being seen upstream of Lower Granite Dam (the state which connects to these tributaries) of over 0.5; many of the fish which were last seen in this state likely reached natal tributaries but were not detected. The three tributaries for which detection efficiency could be estimated had varying homing rates: while the median probability of homing for Asotin Creek individuals was nearly 0.6, the median homing probability was lower for Imnaha River Steelhead at 0.44, and lowest for Tucannon River Steelhead at 0.33. Tucannon River Steelhead had high overshoot rates at Lower Granite Dam (Table 4), leading to a high probability of these fish last being seen upstream of Lower Granite Dam.

Overshooting dams considerably reduced homing probability (Table 6). For some natal origins, this reduction was modest. For example, most Yakima River and Entiat River Steelhead that overshot still were most likely to make it home. For other natal origins, the effect of overshooting was dramatic: the probability of homing for Wenatchee River Steelhead that did not overshoot was four times that of individuals that did.

Fallback probabilities for en-route fallback were generally considerably lower than post-overshoot fallback probabilities (Table 7). Median en-route fallback probabilities were mostly between 0.01 and 0.05; en-route fallback was most likely at McNary Dam. 

# Discussion

## Current limitations and next steps

### Detection probabilities in downstream passage routes
Steelhead fallback is difficult to monitor using PIT tags because of the lack of detection capabilities in the primary downstream passage routes for Steelhead, which include spillways, the Juvenile Bypass System (JBS), navigation locks, ice/trash sluiceways, and turbines. While some passage routes, such as the JBS, the corner collector at Bonneville Dam, and as of 2020, the spillway at Lower Granite Dam, have PIT tag detection capability, the majority of downstream movements are only detected by examining the rest of the detection history. For example, @Boggs2004 used consecutive detections in the same adult fish ladder to monitor rates of fallback, whereas @Richins2018 calculated fallback to home following overshoot as detections in tributaries following detections in the adult fish ladder at a dam upstream of the tributary. Our modeling framework includes both of these ways of detecting fallback, but this is still an underestimate of total fallback. Fallback such as fallback that leads to mortality cannot be detected using PIT tags, and any time a fish is not seen after fallback (i.e., either due to a fish entering a tributary with PIT tag arrays but not being detected, entering a tributary without PIT tag arrays, spawning in the mainstem, or mortality following fallback), the fallback event will not be observed. As such, the current network of PIT tag arrays is incapable of monitoring all fallback and estimates of fallback from this model should be interpreted as lower bound estimates. However, the current modeling framework gives us the closest estimate of fallback possible using PIT tag data.

### Adding additional covariates
The model structure and the use of the categorical logit to evaluate movement probabilities allows for the inclusion of both categorical and continuous covariates in the model. The next covariates that we plan to include in future iterations of the model are rear type (hatchery or wild), temperature (mainstem temperatures from dam tailraces), flow, and spill. We are also considering the addition of covariates related to juvenile experiences (barged vs. not barged, acclimated vs. not acclimated hatchery releases). The inclusion of these continuous covariates will further our understanding of what environmental conditions (e.g., temperature or flow conditions) lead to increased probability of Steelhead choosing more dangerous migration pathways to natal tributaries, such as overshooting natal tributaries. The inclusion of covariates that can be influenced by hydropower managers (e.g., spill or flow) or fishery managers (e.g., hatchery practices or assisted juvenile migration) would help inform how we can help Steelhead return safely to natal tributaries. Given the increased interest in assisting downstream Steelhead passage, such as via spill practices [@Ham2021], the inclusion of these covariates would improve our understanding of how to help recover these populations by informing management practices.

### Increasing model state complexity
As mentioned previously, the current iteration of the model does not use The Dalles Dam or John Day Dam to separate states, and therefore the probability of fallback and overshoot rates at these dams is not being estimated. However, future model iterations could include these dams either by creating a new model that only uses years of data where these dams had PIT tag detectors in the adult fishways, or by modifying the existing model to turn on or off these states, depending on the run year (similar to the current approach with tributary detection efficiency). This would help achieve a better estimate of the true burden of overshoot and fallback throughout the Columbia River Basin, and would be of particular interest for tributaries close to these dams (e.g., Fifteenmile Creek, Deschutes River, and John Day River Steelhead). 

# Management implications
The ability of this modeling framework to incorporate various covariates of interest will allow us to answer a number of pressing management questions surrounding Steelhead overshoot and fallback. For example, winter spill could be included, either as a continuous variable (e.g., amount of spill), a categorical variable (spill or no spill), or an ordinal variable (days of spill). This would allow us to determine what amount of spill is increasing the homing probability, either by decreasing rates of overshoot or increasing rates of post-overshoot fallback. Including flow and spill as covariates could also be used to shed light on if these are increasing en-route fallback or decreasing the probability of upstream movement.

<br>

This model can also shed light on where new PIT tag antenna installations would be most beneficial, as well as assess how recent PIT tag antenna installations (i.e., in the Lower Granite Dam spillway) are helping with monitoring adult movement. Based on our analysis, tributary arrays in the mainstem Salmon, Clearwater, and Grande Ronde Rivers near the mouth would be very helpful, as this would allow us to estimate detection efficiency in these tributaries and therefore vastly improve our estimates of homing. Furthermore, repairing arrays that have recently been damaged and been decommissioned, most notably the Deschutes River Mouth Array, would also be very useful. The Deschutes River is of particular importance because our analysis indicates that fish of all origins have a relatively high probability of entering this tributary, likely due to its documented use as a cold water refuge [@Hess2016; @Snyder2022]; the median probability for Upper Columbia Steelhead was 0.08, for Snake River Basin Steelhead 0.12, and for Middle Columbia Steelhead ranged from 0.13-0.51 (Appendix 2). Therefore, recommissioning this site would be highly beneficial for monitoring its continued use as a cold-water refuge for PIT-tagged Steelhead and other salmonids.

<br> 

This model could also easily handle other datasets of PIT tag detection histories, such as those from other salmonids in the basin.
