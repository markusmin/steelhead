abstract = {Rising river temperatures in western North America have increased the energetic costs of migration and the risk of premature mortality in many Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations. Predicting and managing risks for these populations requires data on acute and cumulative thermal exposure, the spatio-temporal distribution of adverse conditions, and the potentially mitigating effects of cool-water refuges. In this study, we paired radiotelemetry with archival temperature loggers to construct continuous, spatially-explicit thermal histories for 212 adult Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and 200 adult steelhead (O. mykiss). The fish amassed $\sim$500,000 temperature records (30-min intervals) while migrating through 470 kilometers of the Columbia and Snake rivers en route to spawning sites in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Spring- and most summer-run Chinook salmon migrated before river temperatures reached annual highs; their body temperatures closely matched ambient temperatures and most had thermal maxima in the lower Snake River. In contrast, many individual fall-run Chinook salmon and most steelhead had maxima near thermal tolerance limits (20–22 °C) in the lower Columbia River. High temperatures elicited extensive use of thermal refuges near tributary confluences, where body temperatures were $\sim$2–10 °C cooler than the adjacent migration corridor. Many steelhead used refuges for weeks or more whereas salmon use was typically hours to days, reflecting differences in spawn timing. Almost no refuge use was detected in a $\sim$260-km reach where a thermal migration barrier may more frequently develop in future warmer years. Within population, cumulative thermal exposure was strongly positively correlated (0.88 ≤ r ≤ 0.98) with migration duration and inconsistently associated (-0.28 ≤ r ≤ 0.09) with migration date. All four populations have likely experienced historically high mean and maximum temperatures in recent years. Expected responses include population-specific shifts in migration phenology, increased reliance on patchily-distributed thermal refuges, and natural selection favoring temperature-tolerant phenotypes.},

abstract = {Sluiceways at hydroelectric dams are designed to enable floating ice and debris to pass through the dams and may be used as an effective, nonturbine, surface route for out-migrating fishes to pass through dams. Each year, the sluiceway at The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River, USA, is normally operated between 1 April and 30 November and the spillway between 10 April and 31 August to enable downstream-migrating juvenile Pacific salmonids to pass. The only route available for fishes to pass the dam between 1 December and 31 March is through the turbines. This study evaluated downstream passage of adult steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss at The Dalles Dam during various periods between 1 November and 10 April for years 2008 through 2010. The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of operating the sluiceway between 1 December and 31 March to provide a relatively safe, nonturbine, surface outlet for downstream passage of adult steelhead that overwinter in the lower Columbia River (i.e., fallbacks) or for adult steelhead attempting to emigrate back to the marine environment after spawning (i.e., kelts). We applied a fixed-location hydroacoustic technique to estimate downstream passage rates at the sluiceway and turbines. The sluiceway was used by 91-99% of the adult steelhead during all sampling periods; the remaining 1-9% passed through the turbines. This implies that adult steelhead preferred the sluiceway for downstream passage at the dam. Our results indicate that keeping the sluiceway open between 1 December and 31 March may provide an optimal, nonturbine surface route for downstream passage of overwintering or postspawned adult steelhead at The Dalles Dam. Similar operations are relevant at hydroelectric dams with surface-flow outlets, such as sluiceways, for safe downstream passage of fish species of management concern. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {After spawning, iteroparous steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss from the Columbia River basin must navigate several hydroelectric dams on their way to the Pacific Ocean. We used radiotelemetry to investigate migration rates, downstream passage routes, and success of adult steelhead kelts migrating past lower Snake River and Columbia River dams during the springs of 2001 and 2002. Seaward-migrating kelts were collected, radio-tagged, and volitionally released from the juvenile bypass facilities at Lower Granite Dam (LGR) on the Snake River and at McNary Dam (McN) and John Day Dam (JDD) on the Columbia River. Migration success rates from LGR to the study area exit (8 km east of Portland, Oregon) were poorer during the low-flow nonspill conditions of 2001 (4.1%) than in the more typical flow year of 2002 (15.6%). Kelts tagged and released at Columbia River dams had substantially higher migration success than those released on the Snake River; 59.6% and 62.3% of the kelts released at McN and 63.6% and 80.0% of those released at JDD were contacted at the study area exit during 2001 and 2002, respectively. Kelt dam passage was predominately via spillways and surface flow routes, and during periods of spill 90.0% or more kelts typically passed via nonturbine routes. Only 47.2% of kelts were guided out of turbine intakes by screen systems during nonspill periods. Turbine passage, the primary alternative route during nonspill periods, may be a substantial source of kelt mortality. The poor migration success rate of Snake River kelts in both 2001 and 2002 suggests that additional management (i.e., kelt reconditioning, transportation, or both) may be warranted to boost iteroparity rates in this population.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of escapement by adult anadromous salmonids are difficult, especially in large, multistock river systems. We used radiotelemetry and a fishery reward program to calculate escapement, harvest, and unaccounted for loss rates for 10 498 adult chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and 5324 steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during six return years in the Columbia River basin. Mean annual escapements to spawning sites, hatcheries, or the upper bounds of the monitored hydrosystem were 73.4% (spring-summer chinook salmon), 61.3% (fall chinook salmon), and 62.6% (steelhead). Mean reported harvest rates were 8.7% (spring-summer chinook), 22.0% (fall chinook), and 15.1% (steelhead) within the mainstem hydrosystem and 5.9%, 3.4%, and 5.7%, respectively, in lower hydrosystem tributaries. On average, 12%-17% of each run had unknown fates in the mainstem hydrosystem. Escapement, harvest, and loss varied significantly between runs and years, within runs between known-origin subbasin stocks, and between interdam river reaches. Multiyear quantitative assessments like this can reduce uncertainty, clarify inter- and intra-annual variability, and help managers better evaluate fisheries, identify conservation priorities, and help protect evolutionarily significant populations. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC.},

abstract = {During their upstream spawning migration in the Columbia River basin, some adult salmonids Oncorhynchus spp. ascend and then fall back over main-stem hydroelectric dams. Fallback can result in fish injury or death, migration delays, and biases in fishway counts, the primary index for escapement and the basis for production estimates and harvest quotas. We used radiotelemetry to calculate fallback percentages and rates, reascension percentages, biases in fishway escapement estimates due to fallback, and occurrence of behaviorally motivated fallback (correcting overshoot of natal sites) by spring–summer and fall Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha and steelhead O. mykiss. The study area included eight Columbia River and Snake River dams evaluated from 1996 to 2001. For all years combined, about 22% of spring–summer Chinook salmon, 15% of fall Chinook salmon, and 21% of steelhead fell back at least once at a dam. Fallback percentages for spring–summer Chinook salmon were generally highest at Bonneville and the Dalles dams and decreased at progressively upstream dams. Fallback rates for spring–summer Chinook salmon were positively correlated with river discharge. Fallback percentages for steelhead and fall Chinook salmon were less variable between years but were more variable between dams than those of spring–summer Chinook salmon. Reascension percentages at dams ranged widely between runs and sites and were negatively related to the number of fish that entered tributaries downstream from the fallback location. Fall Chinook salmon were the most likely to enter a downstream tributary after falling back, though this behavior was also observed in spring–summer Chinook salmon and steelhead. For all years and at all dams, fallback produced positive fishway count biases ranging from 1% to 16% for spring–summer Chinook salmon, 1% to 38% for fall Chinook salmon, and 1% to 12% for steelhead.},

abstract = {Unlike most anadromous salmonids, summer steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss overwinter in rivers rather than the ocean for 6-10 months prior to spring spawning. Overwintering in rivers may make summer steelhead more vulnerable to harvest and other mortality sources than are other anadromous populations, but there has been little systematic study of this life history strategy. Here, we used a large-scale radiotelemetry study to examine the overwintering behaviors and distributions of 26 summer steelhead stocks within the regulated lower Columbia-Snake River hydrosystem. Over 6 years, we monitored 5,939 fish, of which 3,399 successfully reached spawning tributaries or the upper Columbia River basin and were assigned to specific populations. An estimated 12.4% of fish that reached spawning areas overwintered at least partially within the hydrosystem (annual estimates = 6.8-19.6%), while the remainder overwintered in tributaries. Across all populations, later-arriving fish were more likely to overwinter in the hydrosystem; overwintering percentages ranged from less than 1% for fish tagged in June to over 40% for those tagged in October. Proportionately more interior-basin steelhead (Clearwater, Salmon, and Snake River metapopulations) overwintered in the hydrosystem than did fish from lower-river populations. Steelhead were distributed in mixed-stock assemblages throughout the hydrosystem during winter, usually in reservoirs closest to their home rivers but also in nonnatal tributaries. Overwintering fish moved upstream and downstream between reaches in all months; a nadir occurred in early January and peak egress into spawning tributaries was in March. The estimated survival to tributaries was higher for fish that overwintered in the hydrosystem (82%) than for fish that did not (62%); this difference was largely attributable to low winter harvest rates. Our results suggest that large main-stem habitats, including reservoirs, may be widely used by overwintering summer steelhead. The complex migration behaviors of steelhead indicate both the potential for adaptation and possible susceptibility to future river environment changes. {\textcopyright} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2008.},

abstract = {Most modeling and statistical approaches encourage simplicity, yet ecological processes are often complex, as they are influenced by numerous dynamic environmental and biological factors. Pacific salmon abundance has been highly variable over the last few decades and most forecasting models have proven inadequate, primarily because of a lack of understanding of the processes affecting variability in survival. Better methods and data for predicting the abundance of returning adults are therefore required to effectively manage the species. We combined 31 distinct indicators of the marine environment collected over an 11-year period into a multivariate analysis to summarize and predict adult spring Chinook salmon returns to the Columbia River in 2012. In addition to forecasts, this tool quantifies the strength of the relationship between various ecological indicators and salmon returns, allowing interpretation of ecosystem processes. The relative importance of indicators varied, but a few trends emerged. Adult returns of spring Chinook salmon were best described using indicators of bottom-up ecological processes such as composition and abundance of zooplankton and fish prey as well as measures of individual fish, such as growth and condition. Local indicators of temperature or coastal upwelling did not contribute as much as large-scale indicators of temperature variability, matching the spatial scale over which salmon spend the majority of their ocean residence. Results suggest that effective management of Pacific salmon requires multiple types of data and that no single indicator can represent the complex early-ocean ecology of salmon.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic impacts on riverine systems have, in part, led to management concerns regarding the population status of species using these systems. In an effort to assess the efficacy of restoration actions, and in order to improve monitoring of species of concern, managers have turned to PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag studies with in-stream detectors to monitor movements of tagged individuals throughout river networks. However, quantifying movements in a river network using PIT tag data with incomplete coverage and imperfect detections presents a challenge. We propose a flexible Bayesian analytic framework that models the imperfectly detected movements of tagged individuals in a nested PIT tag array river network. This model structure provides probabilistic estimates of up-stream migration routes for each tagged individual based on a set of underlying nested state variables. These movement estimates can be converted into abundance estimates when an estimate of abundance is available for a location within the river network. We apply the model framework to data from steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Upper Columbia River basin and evaluate model performance (precision/variance of simulated population sizes) as a function of population tagging rates and PIT tag array detection probability densities within the river system using a simulation framework. This simulation framework provides both model validation (precision) and the ability to evaluate expected performance improvements (variance) due to changes in tagging rates or PIT receiver array configuration. We also investigate the impact of different network configurations on model estimates. Results from such investigations can help inform decisions regarding future monitoring and management.},

Therefore, comprehensive, reliable analyses of turbine-induced fish mortality are pivotal to support an informed debate on the sustainability of hydropower (i.e., how much a society is willing to pay in terms of costs incurred on rivers and their biota). We compiled and examined a comprehensive, global data set of turbine fish-mortality assessments involving >275,000 individual fish of 75 species to estimate mortality across turbine types and fish species. Average fish mortality from hydroelectric turbines was 22.3% (95% CI 17.5–26.7%) when accounting for common uncertainties related to empirical estimates (e.g., handling- or catch-related effects). Mortality estimates were highly variable among and within different turbine types, study methods, and taxa.

abstract = {We examined upstream migration patterns of adult Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in relation to environmental factors and two management actions (installation of a rock barrier at a distributary and managed pulse flows). Data was collected using a portable resistance board weir and a Vaki Riverwatcher system that provided accurate daily counts of fall-run Chinook Salmon on their spawning migration. Akaike's information criterion and multimodel inferential approaches, as well as generalized additive models, were used to assess the relative influence of water temperature, flow, moon illumination, weather, operation of a rock barrier, and managed pulse flows to explain the magnitude of daily counts and proportions of Chinook Salmon observed at the weir. Over the 12-year study period (2003–2014), we observed 38,206 Chinook Salmon. The installation of a rock barrier in the lower reaches of the San Joaquin River had positive and consistent influences on daily counts in the years it was installed. Although managed pulse flows to stimulate upstream migration have been used since the early 1990s, our analyses found managed pulse flows only appeared in the top generalized linear models in 2 of the 11 complete years of data analyzed. Managed pulse flows resulted in immediate increases in daily passages, but the response was brief and represented a small portion of the total run. A strong nonlinear response between migratory activity and discharge levels was observed for Chinook Salmon, indicating no additional increase in daily counts when pulse flows exceeded 20 m3/s. Current management requirements in the Stanislaus River exceed this level and adjustment should be considered based on the findings of this study, particularly given the need to balance beneficial uses of a limited water supply. This study provides a scientific approach to determine biologically relevant flow prescriptions for upstream migration of fish in regulated streams.

abstract = {The importance of thermal refuges in a rapidly warming world is particularly evident for migratory species, where individuals encounter a wide range of conditions throughout their lives. In this study, we used a spatially explicit, individual‐based simulation model to evaluate the buffering potential of cold‐water thermal refuges for anadromous salmon and trout (Oncorhynchus spp.) migrating upstream through a warm river corridor that can expose individuals to physiologically stressful temperatures. We considered upstream migration in relation to migratory phenotypes that were defined in terms of migration timing, spawn timing, swim speed, and use of cold‐water thermal refuges. Individuals with different migratory phenotypes migrated upstream through riverine corridors with variable availability of cold‐water thermal refuges and mainstem temperatures. Use of cold‐water refuges (CWRs) decreased accumulated sublethal exposures to physiologically stressful temperatures when measured in degree‐days above 20, 21, and 22°C. The availability of CWRs was an order of magnitude more effective in lowering accumulated sublethal exposures under current and future mainstem temperatures for summer steelhead than fall Chinook Salmon. We considered two emergent model outcomes, survival and percent of available energy used, in relation to thermal heterogeneity and migratory phenotype. Mean percent energy loss attributed to future warmer mainstem temperatures was at least two times larger than the difference in energy used in simulations without CWRs for steelhead and salmon. We also found that loss of CWRs reduced the diversity of energy‐conserving migratory phenotypes when we examined the variability in entry timing and travel time outside of CWRs in relation to energy loss. Energy‐conserving phenotypic space contracted by 7%–23% when CWRs were unavailable under the current thermal regime. Our simulations suggest that, while CWRs do not entirely mitigate for stressful thermal exposures in mainstem rivers, these features are important for maintaining a diversity of migration phenotypes. Our study suggests that the maintenance of diverse portfolios of migratory phenotypes and cool‐ and cold‐water refuges might be added to the suite of policies and management actions presently being deployed to improve the likelihood of Pacific salmonid persistence into a future characterized by climate change.},

abstract = {Mean summer water temperatures in the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada) have increased by $\sim$1.5 °C since the 1950s. In recent years, record high river temperatures during spawning migrations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) have been associated with high mortality events, raising concerns about long-term viability of the numerous natal stocks faced with climate warming. In this study, the effect of freshwater thermal experience on spawning migration survival was estimated by fitting capture-recapture models to telemetry data collected for 1474 adults (captured in either the ocean or river between 2002 and 2007) from four Fraser River sockeye salmon stock-aggregates (Chilko, Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams). Survival of Adams sockeye salmon was the most impacted by warm temperatures encountered in the lower river, followed by that of Stellako-Late Stuart and Quesnel. In contrast, survival of Chilko fish was insensitive to the encountered river temperature. In all stocks, in-river survival of ocean-captured sockeye salmon was higher than that of river-captured fish and, generally, the difference was more pronounced under warm temperatures. The survival-temperature relationships for ocean-captured fish were used to predict historic (1961-1990) and future (2010-2099) survival under simulated lower river thermal experiences for the Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams stocks. A decrease of 9-16% in survival of all these stocks was predicted by the end of the century if the Fraser River continues to warm as expected. However, the decrease in future survival of Adams sockeye salmon would occur only if fish continue to enter the river abnormally early, towards warmer periods of the summer, as they have done since 1995. The survival estimates and predictions presented here are likely optimistic and emphasize the need to consider stock-specific responses to temperature and climate warming into fisheries management and conservation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Anadromous fishes often use various survival tactics while migrating through main stem rivers to successfully reach spawning grounds and reproduce. Mixed-stock assemblages of anadromous adult summer steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss re-enter the Columbia River from late spring through fall including the period of peak summer water temperatures, and previous studies suggest that stocks alter migratory behaviour in response to warm temperatures by seeking cool water refuges. We combined parentage-based tagging with mixed stock analyses to test whether steelhead use a non-natal tributary (Deschutes River, OR, USA) as a thermal refuge and if this migratory behaviour is associated with stock-specific run-timing. Results collected over two migration years indicated that out-of-basin fish in the Deschutes River were disproportionately from specific stocks in the Snake River (Salmon and Grande Ronde) that had migrated through the main stem Columbia River when water temperatures exceeded 21 C. Stocks migrating through the main stem river during cooler temperature periods were either less frequent (Clearwater River), or not encountered (lower Snake River) in the Deschutes River. This study facilitates an improved understanding of stock-specific migratory characteristics associated with environmental conditions in this system. Results potentially affect fisheries management, hatchery protocols, cool-water refuge maintenance, and conservation of wild Deschutes River populations.},

abstract = {The population structure of chinook salmon and steelhead trout is presented as an assimilation of the life history forms that have evolved in synchrony with diverse and complex environments over their Pacific range. As poikilotherms, temperature is described as the overwhelming environmental influence that determines what life history options occur. The different populations represent ecological types referred to as spring-, summer-, fall, and winter-run segments, as well as stream- and ocean-type, or stream- and ocean-maturing life history forms. However, they are more correctly described as a continuum of forms that fall along a temporal cline related to incubation and rearing temperatures that determine spawn timing and juvenile residence patterns. Population structure of chinook salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin, therefore, is the reflection of the genetic composition of the founding source or sources within the respective region, shaped by the environment, principally temperature, that defines life history evolutionary strategy to maximize fitness under the conditions delineated. The key in developing an effective recovery program for chinook salmon and steelhead is to recognize that measures taken must address the genetic and biological requirements of the population unit within the environmental template identified.},

abstract = {The majority of Columbia River summer-run steelhead encounter high river temperatures (near or > 20C) during their spawning migration. While some steelhead pass through the mid-Columbia River in a matter of days, others use tributary habitats as temperature refuges for periods that can last months. Using PIT tag detection data from adult return years 2004–2016, we fit 3-component mixture models to differentiate between “fast”, “slow”, and “overwintering” migration behaviors in five aggregated population groups. Fast fish migrated straight through the reach on average in $\sim$7–9 days while slow fish delayed their migration for weeks to months, and overwintering fish generally took $\sim$150–250 days. We then fit covariate models to examine what factors contributed to the probability of migration delay during summer months (slow or overwintering behaviors), and to explore how migration delay related to mortality. Finally, to account for the impact of extended residence times in the reach for fish that delayed, we compared patterns in estimated average daily rates of mortality between migration behaviors and across population groups. Results suggest that migration delay was primarily triggered by high river temperatures but temperature thresholds for delay were lowest just before the seasonal peak in river temperatures. While all populations groups demonstrated these general patterns, we documented substantial variability in temperature thresholds and length of average delays across population groups. Although migration delay was related to higher reach mortality, it was also related to lower average daily mortality rates due to the proportional increase in reach passage duration being larger than the associated increase in mortality. Lower daily mortality rates suggest that migration delay could help mitigate the impacts of harsh migration conditions, presumably through the use of thermal refuges, despite prolonged exposure to local fisheries. Future studies tracking individual populations from their migration through reproduction could help illuminate the full extent of the tradeoffs between different migration behaviors.},

abstract = {The effects of temperature and flow on the migration of adult Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead O. mykiss through the Columbia River hydrosystem were determined with a novel technique that fits a broken linear model of swim speed versus temperature and flow by partitioning data into speed ranks. Using the migration times of passive integrated transponder (PIT)–tagged adult Chinook salmon upstream between Bonneville and Lower Granite dams (462 km) over the years 1998–2002, we found that a maximum swim speed of about 1 body length/s occurred at 16.3°C. Speed was less above and below this optimum temperature. For PIT-tagged steelhead, migration speed uniformly decreased with increasing temperature, suggesting that the fish migrated at temperatures above the optimum. Migration delay was also a unimodal function of temperature, the minimum delay occurring around 16–17°C. The broken linear model was compared with seven alternative models of unimodal and monotonic speed versus temperature and flow. The unimodal models fit the data better than the monotonic models (when ranked by the Akaike information criterion), and the broken linear model fit the data best. Flow was insignificant in all of the monotonic models and only marginally significant in the unimodal models. The findings of this study have significance in evaluating the effects of hydrosystem operations and climate change on salmon and steelhead fitness.},

abstract = {Lower Granite Dam is the last dam that federally protected Snake River salmonids Oncorhynchus spp. must ascend during their spawning migration. The dam has an adult fish ladder equipped with a trapping system to facilitate fisheries research and hatchery broodstock collection. There are three possible passage routes through the adult ladder: trapped, shunted, and free passage. During the adult trapping season, all fish must swim through 0.305-m shunt pipes outfitted with PIT tag arrays that allow the selection of fish for trapping. Selected fish use the “trapped” route and are kept in a holding area for up to 20 h before being sampled and returned to the ladder. Unselected fish use the “shunted” route and immediately resume upstream migration after swimming through the pipes. When the trap is not in operation, the shunted route is inaccessible, and all fish use the “free passage” route to ascend the ladder without additional impediment. In 2016, a temporary change in ladder operations permitted free passage for a portion of the trapping season. Our study used this rare opportunity to evaluate how different passage routes affect in-ladder transit time and upstream homing success for five salmonid stocks: Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka; steelhead O. mykiss; and spring-, summer-, and fall-run Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha. In 2016, only Sockeye Salmon and spring- and summer-run Chinook Salmon were given access to free passage, and we found evidence that free passage increased subsequent detection at natal sites upstream. An expanded analysis of shunted versus trapped fish during the years 2012–2016 found no difference in rates of detection to home tributaries by route of passage for any of the five fish stocks examined.},

abstract = {Tributary overshoot occurs when adult salmonids homing to natal sites continue upstream past the mouth of their natal stream. Although overshooting is a common behavior by steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Columbia River basin, it has not been adequately quantified or explained. Using multistate release–recapture models, we examined the prevalence of overshooting and fallback to natal tributaries by 37,806 PIT-tagged steelhead from 14 tributaries of the Columbia River basin during 2005–2015. Eight populations had overshooting rates exceeding 50% in at least 1 year. Source of hatchery stock, rearing location, and release practices were found to have appreciable effects on overshoot rates. Overshooting was elevated in hatchery stocks reared upstream of release sites, but this effect may be lessened by utilizing endemic broodstocks and acclimating juveniles within the release basin. For one population of hatchery steelhead, acclimation within the release basin was found to decrease overshooting from 81% to 40%. Across both hatchery and wild populations, successful homing was found to decline 4 percentage points for every 5-percentage-point increase in overshoot rate. Average annual fallback probabilities ranged from 0.18 for Walla Walla River hatchery steelhead to 0.75 for Umatilla River wild steelhead. Fish stocks with the greatest fallback probabilities also had the greatest interannual variability in fallback rates. For John Day River wild steelhead and Tucannon River hatchery steelhead, the interannual range in fallback probabilities exceeded 0.50. We found evidence that spill at dams during March may enhance the fallback of overshooting steelhead and contribute to increased homing to natal tributaries. Therefore, additional attention should be paid to facilitating downstream dam passage of adult salmon.},

abstract = {We used radiotelemetry to evaluate the temporary staging of adult migrating steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss into nonnatal tributary rivers of the Columbia River and to determine the effects of staging behavior on migration rate. By monitoring the movement patterns of 2,900 individual steelhead over 3 years (1996, 1997, and 2000), we determined that an average of 61% of the steelhead destined for upstream areas temporarily staged in one or more tributaries in the lower Columbia River for durations from less than 1 h to 237 d. Median residence time varied significantly by tributary used and year and, based on canonical correlation analysis, was correlated with main-stem Columbia River water temperature. Steelhead that temporarily staged in tributary rivers migrated through the lower Columbia River significantly more slowly than steelhead that did not use tributaries. Use of coolwater tributaries as thermal refugia during warm summertime conditions significantly influences the migratory behavior of Columbia River adult steelhead. Our results highlight the need to preserve the water quality parameters of existing cooler-water Columbia River tributaries and to rehabilitate watersheds that historically maintained cooler-water tributaries as sources of thermal refugia for adult summer steelhead returning to the basin.},

abstract = {There is a long research history addressing olfactory imprinting, natal homing, and non-natal straying by anadromous salmon and trout (Salmonidae). In undisturbed populations, adult straying is a fundamental component of metapopulation biology, facilitating genetic resilience, demographic stability, recolonization, and range expansion into unexploited habitats. Unfortunately, salmonid hatcheries and other human actions worldwide have affected straying in ways that can negatively affect wild populations through competitive interactions, reduced productivity and resiliency, hybridization and domestication effects, and outbreeding depression. Reduced adult straying is therefore an objective for many managed populations. Currently, there is considerable uncertainty about the range of 'natural' stray rates and about which mechanisms precipitate straying in either wild or human-influenced fish. Research in several disciplines indicates that adult straying is affected by endocrine physiology and neurological processes in juveniles, incomplete or interrupted imprinting during rearing and emigration, and by complex interactions among adult maturation processes, reproductive behaviors, olfactory memory, environmental conditions during migration, and senescence physiology. Reported salmonid stray rates indicate that the behavior varies among species, among life-history types, and among populations within species. Most strays enter sites near natal areas, but long-distance straying also occurs, especially in hatchery populations that were outplanted or transported as juveniles. A majority of past studies has estimated straying as demographic losses from donor populations, but some have estimated straying into recipient populations. Most recipient-based estimates have substantiated concerns that wild populations are vulnerable to swamping by abundant hatchery and farm-raised strays. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},
